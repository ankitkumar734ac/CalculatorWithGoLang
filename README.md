## Extra Features
- Whenever we click on our “History” button we want to remove the string from the array and display it on our history.
- - How it work 
- - - Now inside our history function, we’ll run a reverse for loop because we want to print the last string of operation as our recent most history.
Then well add the history array inside our history string.And will print each operation on a new line.
